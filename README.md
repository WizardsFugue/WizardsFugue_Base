This is the base package of the WizardsFugue Project.


It is intended to provide ways for working with more then one framework in the same project.  
Main focus is for now Magento, because thats what I want and what I care about  
But Iam happy if you want to help providing support for other Frameworks.

For Magento I can say, we first want to make it full working with composer,
so we need to provide some patches and scripts.

A thing we care much about is creating documentation, not only patches and script.  
We want to explain how you archive your goals, because every bigger project is unique.
It would not be possible, to provide a solution which works for most users who want to use 
two frameworks or application in the same environment.
